        <p><I>
           <b>I</b> <br></br>
      It was all a world of games and endless days ,<br></br>
          wandering through life's modest maze ,<br></br>
         The fields looked wide , so the mind was ,<br></br>
           The heart was free , so the passion was .<br></br>
      Hath aspiring dreams beneath the old oak tree , <br></br>
      " Maybe some fulfilled , and some yet to be !! "<br></br>
     " Days went like bare thoughts do these days "...   <br></br>
 Hath chased the infinite clouds but toppled on stone,<br></br>
"Atleast, hath a heart untouched by love's unknowns"<br></br>

<br></br><B>II</B><br></br>
        Thy soul was aware of what thy heart needed ,<br></br>
         Maybe was craving for the love's tender plea<br></br>
      But thy restless heart doth never to be deceived , <br></br>
    Kept wandering free , through dreams and reality... <br></br>
             " The search for connection subdued , <br></br>
                     But thy heart remained distant , <br></br>
                        untouched by love's glow ,<br></br>
           Embracing the freedom that only few know <br></br>
            Marking thy restless heart solemnly thine ".<br></br> 
                                       
            <br></br><b>III</b><br></br>
             For years do pass like fleeting seasons do ,<br></br>
 Never realised the phase which I was going through .<br></br>
                    Just the heart , marked thine ,<br></br>
            Just the passion , as fine as Italian wine .<br></br>
              With burden of everlasting thoughts ,<br></br>
                   with expectations hum along .<br></br>
            Spilling out the spell of intense worry , <br></br>
             Like how corrosive caustics do bury .<br></br>
                   Felt the intensity of chores , <br></br>
               Lost the Peace of Mind , no more ..<br></br>
  But failed to persuade thy entire soul convincing :<br></br>
    “ that Physics need not grace the chef's domain,<br></br>
     Nor must chemistry adorn the athlete's refrain.”<br></br>
But the wisdom of intwined discipline still remained,<br></br>
    Yet , truth kept defying the freedom unchained. <br></br>

    <br></br><B>IV</B><br></br>
           With thine worthy passion , waning away ,<br></br>
I yearned even more for the ties of love , multiplying.<br></br>
         Soon , amid god's mysteries , love I did see ,<br></br>
            A testament divine , unfolding for thee .<br></br>
      Gazes locked , conveying gossips of the lost star ,<br></br>                           
                " Helix Nebula speaking volumes , <br></br>
                 beyond mere words can ever last ."<br></br>
 
                 <br></br> <B>V</B><br></br>
            For I mistook love to be a fleeting star ,<br></br>
           As rare as Halley's comet in the sky afar .<br></br>
             Enthralled by the spring's floral array ,<br></br>
                When thy love for u didn't sway .<br></br>
                    For in the season of bloom ,<br></br>
                   I longed to claim you mine .<br></br>
       I always stared at you with thy solstice eyes ,<br></br>
      Carving for those sophisticated looks of glory.<br></br>
  We vowed to weave dreams from Stardust and light   <br></br>
  But the worthiest one was :<br></br>
   “ will you forever be mine ? ” ...<br></br>
 
   <br></br> <B>VI</B><br></br>
                 A dream , doth serene and bright ,  <br></br>
  As we basked together in the summer's golden light..<br></br>
       Shared a mystic chemistry , volatile and free ,<br></br>
   While our love surged like a storm upon the Sea...<br></br>
 In the season of love , as we felt petrichor's embrace, <br></br> 
  Dancing in the very first rain ,<br></br>
   we found our perfect place...<br></br>
  
   <br></br><B>VII</B><br></br>
       But With the very onset of leaves falling down,  <br></br>
          Our love began to wane , losing its crown. <br></br> 
     The crisp air spoke of change, so bold and cold,  <br></br>
       In the fading autumn, our story lost its hold. <br></br>
         As winter's chill arrived with frosty grace ,<br></br>
           Our hearts grew more and more distant ,<br></br>
    No more touch to veil , no more warmth to hail . <br></br>

    <br></br> <B>VIII</B><br></br>
It all ended before the faded leaves could ever revive<br></br>
          As Autumn's soft breath whispered low ,<br></br>
             Promises , like sand , began to go .<br></br>
            Fading with leaves in a gentle sigh ,<br></br>
          Trust and hope drifted , just left to die....<br></br>
  In the chill of Twilight , where our memories do lie,<br></br>
We bid our last goodbyes beneath the murky , brisk sky...<br></br>
     
<br></br> <B>IX</B><br></br>
                Returned to thy worthy fervor ,<br></br>
                   the one that faded long ago ,<br></br>
       For in the search of Redamancy , all I found <br></br>
     were emotions performing an act of diolomacy..<br></br>
        But perhaps the weight of time and strain ,<br></br>
      Collected broken pieces, mending the pain.<br></br>
          Turning those shards into Kintsugi's art,<br></br>
              Storing memories, a hopeful heart.<br></br>

              <br></br> <B>X</B><br></br>
       Now I've lost hope for the passion that's dead ,<br></br>
   And become an Amorist , where thy heart is led ...<br></br>
   Turning through the pages of thy heart’s own twist, <br></br> 
       Seeking a chapter that's lost, to find its end ,<br></br>  
           For poetry’s end is a journey to amend .  <br></br><br></br>

     <B> But how can I end it, when the start's unclear?  <br></br>
          The story's beginning is what I still fear...</B><br></br>
